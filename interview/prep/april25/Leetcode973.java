/*
 * 973. K Closest Points to Origin
 * Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, 
 * return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
 * The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
 * You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
 * Constraints:
   ** 1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
   ** -104 <= xi, yi <= 104
* Example :
   ** Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
   ** Output: [[-2,2]]
   ** Explanation:
     *** The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
     *** The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
     *** Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
     ** We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
