/*
 * 162. Find Peak Element
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * 
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
 * If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 *
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. 
 * In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
 * 
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 * 
 * Constraints:
   ** 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
   ** -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
   ** nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
